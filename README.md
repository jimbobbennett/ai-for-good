# AI for Good 

## Overview

This curriculum is designed to take students through a series of lessons with hands-on exercises that will introduce them to concepts in artificial intelligence, data processing and data visualization that can be applied to solve real world problems using services from Microsoft Azure.

## Lesson 1: Discovering AI

### Overview

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating applications that mimic the cognitive functions that we associate with the human mind such as learning or problem solving. The goal of an AI application is to analyze its environment and to take actions that maximize the chances of success. AI does this through the use of mathematics, computational intelligence, statistics and probability. Artificial Intelligence has use cases in almost every business or field of study and is commonly used to solve problems such as search,reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

## Lesson 2: Problem Analysis

### Overview

You are the leader of a group of climate scientists who are concerned about the dwindling polar-bear population in the Arctic. As such, your team has placed hundreds of motion-activated cameras at strategic locations throughout the region. Rather than manually examine each photograph to determine whether it contains a polar bear, you have been challenged to devise an automated system that processes data from these cameras in real time and displays an alert on a map when a polar bear is photographed.

You need a solution that incorporates real-time stream processing to analyze raw data for potential sightings, and one that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether a photo contains a polar bear. And you need it fast, because climate change won't wait.

## Lesson 3: Machine Learning 

### Overview

Your solution to this point has incorporated an array of cameras that are strategically positioned throughout the research region. Your data is currently being ingested as live streaming data. Now you need to work with this data.

You need a solution that incorporates real-time stream processing to analyze raw data for potential sightings, and one that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether a photo contains a polar bear.

In this lesson, you will learn about the tools necessary to gather, analyze, and respond correctly to the live data that is coming into your solution.

## Lesson 4: Solving Problems

### Overview

Your solution to this point has incorporated an array of cameras that are strategically positioned throughout the research region. Your data is currently being ingested as live streaming data. Now you need to work with this data.

Additionally, you created components for the solution that incorporate real-time stream processing and analyze raw data for potential sightings. You then built stream analytics and have created data for images that match polar bears within the focus region.

In this lesson, you will complete your study by learning about tools that can be used to visualize the collected data.
