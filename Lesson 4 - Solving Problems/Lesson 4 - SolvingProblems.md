## Exercise 5: Visualizing Data with Power BI ##

The goal of business intelligence is being able to quickly identify and respond to ever-changing trends in business and industry. Whether youâ€™re a data analyst delivering reports and analytics to your organization or a stakeholder or decision-maker in need of critical insights, Power BI can organize and unify all of your organization's data to provide a clear view of the world around you.

[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) was created to address the data explosion in commercial and academic organizations, the need to analyze that data, and the need for rich, interactive visuals to represent the data and reveal key insights. It contains a suite of tools that assist in data analysis, from data discovery and collection to data transformation, aggregation, sharing, and collaboration. Moreover, it allows you to create rich visualizations and package them in interactive dashboards.

In this exercise, you will connect Microsoft Power BI to the Azure SQL database you created in the previous exercise to capture information emanating from the virtual camera array you deployed in the Arctic. Then you will use Power BI to build a report that shows in near real-time where polar bears are being spotted.
