# Visualizing Data with Power BI  

## Overview    

Your solution to this point has incorporated an array of cameras that are strategically positioned throughout the research region.  Your data is currently being ingested as live streaming data.  Now you need to work with this data. 

Additionally, you created components for the solution that incorporate real-time stream processing and analyze raw data for potential sightings. You then built stream analytics and have created data for images that match polar bears within the focus region. 

In this lesson, you will complete your study by learning about tools that can be used to visualize the collected data.   

## Lesson 4: Visualize the collected data using a Power BI solution  

In order to visualize the data, you need a powerful tool that is easy to use and will aggregate and display relevant information for further analysis. 

Power BI is the appropriate tool to meet your needs.  

## Power BI ##    

Power BI is the tool of choice for data visualization on Azure.  The tools available in PowerBI allow you to build solutions that give you a `big picture` overview of the data, which can help you identify trends and patterns you might have otherwise missed.

With Power BI solutions, you will empower your team to make informed decisions.  As the team makes these important decisions, they can be certain that their decision is validated by the data that has been collected.  

Furthermore, having the data readily displayed gives your team the ability to plan and respond to any situation.  This will give your team more effective vision, and will likely have other side effects like a higher morale.  A team that knows their work is making an impact will likely be more excited to continue to do great work.  

Power BI also provides the ability to track important trends in your data, which can give you indications of when things are going well, as well as when things are not going so well.  Having this information gives you the tools you need to react and change your approach if necessary to ensure your company's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are being met.  

### Advantages of Power BI ###  

As mentioned above, Power BI gives your team a clear advantage when data is combined with visual results.  

In addition to the benefits above, there are many other advantages to using Power BI.  They include, but are not limited to:  

-   Microsoft is a trusted industry leader  

-   Fully able to leverage Microsoft Information Production and Cloud App Security, including governance and risk analysis  

-   Free tier offers a low entry barrier for all  

-   Simplify your analysis and information sharing processes around big data  

-   Leverage Microsoft AI to quickly find answers within your data  

-   Use your current Excel to build reports and publish data from Excel

-   Turn your insights into action  

-   Stream and visualize your data reporting as events happen in real-time

# Challenge # 

## Visualize 

In this exercise, you will connect Microsoft Power BI to the Azure SQL database you created in the previous exercise to capture information emanating from the virtual camera array you deployed in the Arctic. Then you will use Power BI to build a report that shows in near real-time where polar bears are being spotted.

After completing the PowerBI implementation, you will write a paper to discuss how someone could use the AI tools you have learned in conjunction with PowerBI to provide new insights into a problem, or to help or treat an existing problem.

## Objectives ##

In this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Connect Power BI to an Azure SQL database  
- Use Power BI to visualize data written to the database  
- Create a report that can be shared with colleagues  

## Complete the following exercises ##
