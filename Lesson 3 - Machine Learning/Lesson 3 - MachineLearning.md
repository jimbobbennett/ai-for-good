## Exercise 3: Analyze Data with Stream Analytics and Azure Functions

[Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/) is a cloud-based service for ingesting high-velocity data streaming from devices, sensors, applications, Web sites, and other data sources and analyzing that data in real time. It supports a [SQL-like query language](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn834998.aspx) that works over dynamic data streams and makes analyzing constantly changing data no more difficult than performing queries on static data stored in traditional databases. With Azure Stream Analytics, you can set up jobs that analyze incoming data for anomalies or information of interest and record the results, present notifications on dashboards, or even fire off alerts to mobile devices. And all of it can be done at low cost and with a minimum of effort.

Scenarios for the application of real-time data analytics are many and include fraud detection, identity-theft protection, optimizing the allocation of resources (think of an Uber-like transportation service that sends drivers to areas of increasing demand *before* that demand peaks), click-stream analysis on Web sites, and countless others. Having the ability to process data *as it comes in* rather than waiting until after it has been aggregated offers a competitive advantage to businesses that are agile enough to make adjustments on the fly.

In this lab, the second of four in a series, you will create an Azure Stream Analytics job and connect it to the IoT hub you created in the previous exercise. Then you will write an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) to receive the output, and use the two of them together to analyze data streaming in from a simulated camera array.

### Objectives ###

In this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Create a Stream Analytics job and test queries on sample data streams
- Run a Stream Analytics job and perform queries on live data streams
- Use an Azure IoT hub as a Stream Analytics input
- Use an Azure Function as a Stream Analytics output

## Exercise 4: Predicting Results with Cognitive Services

[Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/ "Microsoft Cognitive Services") is a suite of services and APIs backed by machine learning that enables developers to incorporate intelligent features such as facial recognition in photos and videos, sentiment analysis in text, and language understanding into their applications. Microsoft's [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) is among the newest members of the Cognitive Services suite. Its purpose is to create image-classification models that "learn" from labeled images you provide. Want to know if a photo contains a picture of a flower? Train the Custom Vision Service with a collection of flower images, and it can tell you whether the next image includes a flower â€” or even what type of flower it is.

The Custom Vision Service exposes two APIs: the [Custom Vision Training API](https://southcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/d9a10a4a5f8549599f1ecafc435119fa/operations/58d5835bc8cb231380095be3) and the [Custom Vision Prediction API](https://southcentralus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/eb68250e4e954d9bae0c2650db79c653/operations/58acd3c1ef062f0344a42814). You can build, train, and test image-classification models using the [Custom Vision Service portal](https://www.customvision.ai/), or you can build, train, and test them using the Custom Vision Training API. Once a model is trained, you can use the Custom Vision Prediction API to build apps that utilize it. Both are REST APIs that can be called from a variety of programming languages.

In this exercise, you will create a Custom Vision Service model and train it to differentiate between various types of Arctic wildlife. Then you will connect it to the Stream Analytics job you created in the previous lab.

### Objectives ###

In this exercise, you will learn how to:

- Use the Custom Vision Service to train an image-classification model
- Test a Custom Vision Service model
- Call the model from an app or service
